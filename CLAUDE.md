# Night Farming - Game Development Progress

## Project Overview

Night Farming is a browser-based farming simulation game inspired by Stardew Valley, built with Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The game features a top-down farming experience with smooth movement, collision detection, and a planned gradual introduction of horror elements.

## Current Features

### Core Game Mechanics

- **Advanced Farming System**: Multiple seed types with unique watering requirements and growth patterns
- **Individual Seed Tools**: Each seed type functions as its own selectable tool
- **Progressive Watering**: Different crops require different amounts of water to grow
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Crops sell for different amounts based on their difficulty to grow
- **Time Management**: Game clock system affecting crop growth timing

### Movement & Physics

- **Smooth Pixel Movement**: 60 FPS movement system that transitions smoothly between grid positions
- **Collision Detection**: Impassable terrain (water, walls, trees, doors) with debug visualization
- **Player Facing**: Character faces the direction of last movement for intuitive farming actions
- **Target-Ahead Actions**: Farming actions target the tile in front of the player based on facing direction

### World & Camera

- **Enclosed Farm Settlement**: 40x30 tile world completely surrounded by protective fencing (üî∏)
- **Forest Atmosphere**: Dense trees just inside the perimeter create a wilderness feeling
- **Compact Farm Area**: 12x12 farmable area for focused, manageable cultivation
- **Repositioned Water Feature**: Water (üíß) moved to bottom-right corner for better layout balance
- **Guided Pathways**: Brown dirt paths (üü´) connect key areas for natural navigation
  - **House ‚Üí Farm**: Direct path from front door to farm center
  - **Farm ‚Üí Town**: Horizontal path leading to the fence opening
- **Fence Opening Exit**: Natural gap in right-side fencing leads to town (no walls needed)
- **Camera System**: Follows player smoothly, clamped to world boundaries
- **Viewport Culling**: Only renders visible tiles for performance
- **Scene Transitions**: Seamless movement between exterior farm and interior house

### Advanced Crop System

#### Multiple Seed Types

- **ü•ï Parsnip Seeds**:
  - Easy beginner crop requiring only 1 watering total
  - 3 growth stages: üå± ‚Üí üåø ‚Üí üåæ ‚Üí ü•ï
  - Sells for 50 coins
  - Grows quickly with minimal care

- **ü•î Potato Seeds**:
  - Advanced crop requiring 3 waterings total
  - 4 growth stages: üå± ‚Üí üåø ‚Üí üü´ ‚Üí üî∏ ‚Üí ü•î
  - Sells for 80 coins (higher reward for difficulty)
  - Requires careful water management

#### Sophisticated Watering Mechanics

- **Watering Tracking**: Each crop individually tracks waterings received vs required
- **Stage-Based Requirements**: Crops must be fully watered before advancing to next growth stage
- **Visual Feedback**: Partially watered crops show üíß indicator
- **Reset System**: Watering counters reset after each growth stage advance
- **Progressive Growth**: Only fully watered crops can advance stages over time

### UI & Interface Evolution

#### Dynamic Toolbar System

- **Individual Seed Tools**: Each seed type appears as its own tool slot
- **Smart Tool Generation**: Toolbar dynamically generates based on current inventory
- **Automatic Key Mapping**: Number keys (1-5+) automatically map to available tools
- **Visual States**: Tools show count badges, disable when empty, highlight when selected
- **Extensible Design**: Easy to add new tools/seeds that automatically get toolbar slots

#### Enhanced UI Layout

- **Bottom-Center Toolbar**: Large, prominent tool selection with enhanced styling
- **Top-Right Time Panel**: Game clock (6:00 AM start) with coins display
- **Tool Organization**: Base tools first (Hoe, Water, Harvest), then available seeds
- **Count Badges**: Seed tools show remaining quantity with stylized counters
- **Disabled States**: Empty seed tools gray out and become unclickable

### Scene System & NPCs

- **Multi-Scene World**: Three connected areas - farm exterior, house interior, and town square
- **Walkthrough Transitions**: Automatic scene changes by walking through exit tiles (no spacebar needed)
- **Town Square**: 30x25 town area with buildings, fountain, and cobblestone paths
- **Improved Exit System**: Simple, intuitive entrance points
  - **Farm ‚Üí Town**: 3-tile fence opening on right edge (üåÜ tiles) - walk through the gap
  - **Town ‚Üí Farm**: 3-tile exit on far left edge (üöú tiles) - maximum separation for clarity
- **Natural Pathways**: Brown paths lead directly to fence openings
- **House Interior**: Smaller interior space with furniture, centered with black void background
- **Door Interactions**: Use spacebar on doors to enter/exit house (house only)

#### NPC System

- **Smooth NPC Movement**: NPCs move with pixel-perfect movement similar to player
- **Meandering AI**: Mary follows town pathways, visiting each building with natural pauses
- **Building Visits**: Mary stops in front of each building (3+ second pauses) before continuing
- **Pathway Navigation**: NPCs use the brown pathway system to navigate naturally
- **Variable Movement**: Slower speed (1.5px/frame) creates relaxed, contemplative feel
- **Dialogue System**: Interactive conversations with spacebar activation
- **Mary Character**: Friendly town resident (üë©‚Äçüåæ) with location-aware dialogue
- **Interaction Range**: Walk within 1.5 tiles of NPCs to interact
- **Modal Dialogue**: Full-screen dialogue boxes with NPC portraits and continue prompts

### Time Management

- **Game Clock**: Starts at 6:00 AM, advances 10 minutes every 5 seconds real-time
- **12-Hour Format**: Displays with AM/PM for natural time reading
- **Growth Timing**: Crops grow based on game time intervals (3 seconds per stage when watered)
- **Visual Integration**: Clock prominently displayed with enhanced padding

- **Direct Planting**: Select parsnip tool ‚Üí plant parsnips, select potato tool ‚Üí plant potatoes
- **Inventory-Based Availability**: Seeds only appear as tools when you have them
- **Future-Ready Architecture**: Built for planned user-customizable toolbar organization

### Advanced Watering Requirements

- **Parsnips**: Simple 1-watering system for beginners
- **Potatoes**: Complex 3-watering system requiring planning and resource management
- **Progressive Growth**: Crops won't advance until watering requirements are met
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indicators for watering progress and completion

### Enhanced User Experience

- **Larger UI Elements**: More prominent toolbar and time display
- **Better Visual Hierarchy**: Clear separation between tools and inventory
- **Intuitive Controls**: Direct tool selection without multi-step processes
