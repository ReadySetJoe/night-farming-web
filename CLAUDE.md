# Night Farming - Game Development Progress

## Project Overview

Night Farming is a browser-based farming simulation game inspired by Stardew Valley, built with Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The game features a top-down farming experience with smooth movement, collision detection, stamina management, physics-based item collection, save system, and multiple connected scenes including a dedicated combat arena. The architecture is designed for gradual introduction of horror elements.

## Current System Status ‚úÖ

### ‚ö° Stamina System (COMPLETE)
- **Daily Resource Management**: 100 stamina max, depletes with actions and time
- **Action Costs**: Farming (1), Tree chopping (3), with stamina gates preventing overuse
- **Time Decay**: Gradual stamina loss (0.1 per 5 seconds) creates time pressure
- **Sleep Recovery**: Only sleeping in bed restores stamina to full and advances day
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded stamina bar with exhaustion warnings

### üéØ Physics-Based Item System (COMPLETE)
- **Item Drops**: Crops and wood items "pop out" with realistic physics
- **Magnetic Collection**: Items attracted to player when in range with pickup delays
- **Pickup Timing**: Wood (1.5s delay), Crops (0.5s delay) prevents instant collection
- **Toolbar Integration**: All collected items go directly to expanded toolbar inventory

### üè† Multi-Scene World System (COMPLETE)
- **Exterior Farm** (40x30): Main farming world with house, water, trees, and paths
- **House Interior** (12x8): Player's home with bed, furniture, save functionality
- **Town Square** (30x25): Central hub with buildings, NPCs, fountain, pathways
- **Arena** (20x15): Combat-ready arena with stone walls and torch decorations
- **Building Interiors**: General Store, Blacksmith, Cozy House (each with unique layouts)
- **Seamless Transitions**: Walkthrough exits between all connected areas

### üåæ Advanced Farming System (COMPLETE)
- **Multi-Stage Crops**: Parsnips (1 watering), Potatoes (3 waterings) with visual growth
- **Individual Seed Tools**: Each seed type is its own selectable toolbar tool
- **Progressive Watering**: Crops advance stages only when watering requirements met
- **Economic Balance**: Higher difficulty crops yield better profits (50 vs 80 coins)
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Strategic crop selection based on effort vs reward

### üíæ Save System (COMPLETE)
- **Bed Interaction**: Walk onto bed to trigger save prompt
- **Day Advancement**: Sleeping increments day counter and resets time to 6:00 AM
- **State Persistence**: Complete game state saved to localStorage
- **Scene Recovery**: Exterior world properly backed up during house visits
- **Auto-Load**: Saved games automatically restore on page refresh

### üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Movement & Physics (COMPLETE)
- **Smooth Pixel Movement**: 60 FPS movement with grid-to-pixel transitions
- **Dynamic Collision**: Collision detection adapts to different world sizes
- **Scene-Aware Navigation**: Movement constraints adjust per scene
- **Player Facing**: Character orientation affects action targeting
- **Camera Following**: Smooth camera tracking with boundary clamping

### üéÆ UI & Controls (COMPLETE)
- **Dynamic Toolbar**: 10-slot expandable toolbar (keys 1-0) with count badges
- **Tool Management**: Base tools + inventory items automatically populate slots
- **Visual States**: Disabled tools, selection highlights, count indicators
- **Time Display**: Game clock with day counter in top-right corner
- **Debug Mode**: F3 toggle for terrain type visualization and collision boundaries

### üë• NPC System (COMPLETE)

3. **Manage**: Balance stamina between activities and time pressure
4. **Save**: Sleep in bed to save progress and advance to next day
5. **Combat**: Enter arena (left exit) when combat system is implemented

## Next: Combat System Implementation

The codebase is now clean, well-documented, and ready for combat system development. All foundational systems are complete and tested, providing a solid base for adding combat mechanics to the dedicated arena space.
