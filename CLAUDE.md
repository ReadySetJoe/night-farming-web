# Night Farming - Game Development Progress

## Project Overview

Night Farming is a browser-based **horror farming simulation** game inspired by Stardew Valley, built with Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The game features a top-down farming experience with smooth movement, collision detection, stamina management, physics-based item collection, save system, **progressive horror elements**, **dynamic day/night cycle**, **corrupted crops**, **multiple enemy types**, **atmospheric music system**, and multiple connected scenes including a dedicated combat arena.

**üåô KEY HORROR FEATURES:**
- **Progressive Horror Levels** (0-10) based on days survived
- **Corrupted Crop System** with visual decay progression  
- **Day/Night Cycle** with atmospheric darkness overlay
- **Dynamic Enemy Spawning** (Bats at night, Skeletons in nightmare mode)
- **Horror Events** (Whispers, Shadow Figures, Blood Moon)
- **Scene-Based Dynamic Music** with horror overlays
